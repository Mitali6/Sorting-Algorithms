In this repository, I have tried covering following sorting algorithms with a little explanation, their time and space complexities along with the source code.

**1. Selection Sort** - Selection sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list.

**2. Bubble Sort** - Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that compares two adjacent elements and swaps them until they are in the intended order. 

**2. Insertion Sort** - Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that works by iteratively inserting each element of an unsorted list into its correct position in a sorted portion of the list.
